Hey, attached is a suggested redesign for Fitness Monkey. It's mostly rearrangement and simplification of elements, a new color palette, and a new font. I may have time to think of a new logo, but I want to see if the Fitness Monkey team likes my direction first. 

If they do like the direction, tell them to try to extrapolate and follow my aesthetic (colors, spacing, etc.) when designing the rest of the UI that I didn't have time to get to. They can ask me any questions via email and when I come in on Wednesday if they need to.

Attached are also the color palette with hex codes, and the Proxima Nova font that I used.

Please share this email and the attached files with the Fitness Monkey team. Thanks!
David
