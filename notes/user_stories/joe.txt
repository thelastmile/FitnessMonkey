 If I was a user the goal of this site would have  to motivate users to  overcome their addictions and become a Fitness Monkey by educating them about the importance of staying healthy and  being motivated to stay fit. The site should compel users to get involved by creating their own detailed work out plan with the help of personal trainer and listening to  testimonials from former addicts and fitness junkies.
