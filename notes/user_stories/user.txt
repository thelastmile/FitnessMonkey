1. As a potential new user, I'd be interested to see the immediate benefits I can gain by joining Fitness Monkey(workout routines, nutrition suggestions, community base, enrollment process. I want to be part of a healthy driven community with (1)easy to understand instructions,(2) tips on how I can incorporate a workout routine into my busy life as a businesswoman and single mother of three children,(3), (4) testimonials/pictures of success stories.

*My experience on this site should resonate on a practical level. As a user, I'd expect to see an easy enrollment process. A clear benefit I can gain out of it in a short period of time. Gradual easy to achieve "Fitness" goals make feel empowered to strive for higher health "Fitness" goals and believe that I will be successful in incorporating this exercises plan into my daily life's tasks.
	
	~I expect a visual variety of images about Fitness Monkey's members to inspired me joining, despite my  body type.

	~I also expect a step-by-step workout image or video I can download, and perhaps a nearby establishment/outdoor park where I can join other Fitness Monkey's members.

*As a potential user, I want an experience  with the ability to easily jump sections when I want without navigating to new tabs/browser windows. I also want something that I can access from my mobile phone. It must be easy to understand without to much text, perhaps more visual.

*As a user, I expect that the site/app will be easy to get enroll, learn more about its features, premium base. I'd expect to see an appealing call to take control of my health at the top of the home page, encouraging me to subscribe and become a Fitness Monkey member, reassuring me that "Never is to late to begin my sobriety and/or take charge of my overall health."This invitation should make feel  welcomed.

(1) healthy eating habit choices,
(2) tips on how to improve my health,
(3) a sense of belonging 
(4) assistance to tailor an appropriate routine for an old man like me,
(5) reinforcement for personal accomplishments.
