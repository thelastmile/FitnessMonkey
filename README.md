README FILE - FITNESS MONKEY

Greetings Team,

	This is what we have going so far on the Fitness Monkey Project. Our goal is to use the left 2/3 of the page to create a more traditional web page layout, while the right 1/3 will demo the app that will be catered to the individual member.

	Our goal is to create an app that can track a member's Fitness and Recovery success. We've loaded up the scripts/workout.json file with a month's worth of workout data and will use it to create a D3 visualization with the days worked out along the X-axis and the duration of the workouts along the Y-axis. 

	We look forward to your feedback on making this site/app cool, fresh, and inspirational.

	Thanks,

	Team Fitness Monkey

Greetings Team,

	It was finals week here at Code.7370, but we did manage to start putting together some data visualizations that load from the data/workouts.json file. I've included some screenshots in the notes folder and look forward to your feedback.

	One of the biggest challenges right now is formatting the data and making it useful, cool, & interactive for our members.  All things I know we can overcome.

	I received some interesting feedback from Nate, one of the mentors who suggested that when the page loads, you see the carousel, the login, and the more traditional website content, but after a member signs in, they would only see a user dashboard where they can select from various workout challenges, log their workouts, log relapses should they happen, and see various charts that moniter their progress.

	Project Gamify:

	If we get that far, we're hoping to allow members to chart their results against a leader board of other Fitness Monkey challengers and give them the opportunity to share and connect with other Fitness Monkey members.

	Now that the finals in the books, we've got 4 weeks to make it happen.  Thanks for your support.

	Chris

Greetings Team,

	It's official, Hans and Beverly are equity members of Team Fitness Monkey. We've separated our work into two pages. The landing page is index.html and the app page is working_copy.html.  We're still trying to sort out the data visualization charts and figuring out what will be the most useful data to keep our members fit & sober

	We're also playing around with animations, so we'd appreciate your feedback on those items as well.

	Thank you for your support.

	Chris,
